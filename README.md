# gridrunner

A simple grid game written in TypeScript using Bun.

## Getting Started

To run the server, run `bun src/server.ts` and to run the client, run `bun src/client.ts`.

## Roadmap

- [x] Set up project folder structure
- [x] Create Player class and logic
- [ ] Implement GameServer class for managing players and game state
- [ ] Implement GameClient class for player input and communication
- [ ] Implement server - client communcation using UDP sockets

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
